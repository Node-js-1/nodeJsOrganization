 ## Introduction to the Back Pressure Task in Node.js

 What is Back Pressure in Node.js Streams?

 Back pressure in Node.js streams occurs when data is read from a source at a faster rate than it can be processed or written to the destination. It's akin to a traffic jam in data flow, where the buffer fills up faster than it can be emptied, leading to potential performance issues or memory overflow.


 ## Key Concepts:

 ## Streams: In Node.js, streams are objects that let you read data from a source or write data to a destination in a continuous fashion.


## Buffer Management: A buffer temporarily holds data before it's moved. Proper buffer management is key to handling back pressure.
 ## Event Handling: Node.js uses events to handle stream operations. Key events include 'data', 'end', and 'drain'.

 ## Flow Control: This exercise will demonstrate how to control the flow of data to prevent buffer overflow.
