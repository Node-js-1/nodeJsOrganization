# Setup Instructions for Node.js Development

## Introduction
Welcome to the Node.js course! Before we dive into learning and building with Node.js, it's important to set up your development environment. This document provides step-by-step instructions to get you started.

## Installing Node.js
Node.js is a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine. To install Node.js:

### For Windows and macOS:
1. Visit the Node.js download page: [Node.js Downloads](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
2. Download the installer for your operating system (Windows Installer or macOS Installer).
3. Run the downloaded installer and follow the prompts to install Node.js and npm (Node package manager).

### For Linux:
Node.js installation can vary depending on your Linux distribution. Here's a general guide:
1. Update your package repository:
  sudo apt update 

2. Install Node.js:
  sudo apt install nodejs

3. Install npm:
  sudo apt install npm

Verify the installation by running:

node -v
npm -v 

This should display the installed versions of Node.js and npm.

## Setting Up a Text Editor / IDE
While you can use any text editor, we recommend Visual Studio Code or Atom for their excellent support for JavaScript and Node.js.

### Visual Studio Code
1. Download from [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
2. Install the application and open it.
3. (Optional) Install useful extensions like `ESLint`, `Prettier`, and `Node.js Modules Intellisense`.


## Additional Tools
Some additional tools that may be useful:

- **Git**: Version control system. [Git Downloads](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
- **Postman**: For testing APIs. [Download Postman](https://www.postman.com/downloads/)
- **Robo 3T / Studio 3T**: GUI for MongoDB. [Download Robo 3T](https://robomongo.org/)

## Next Steps
After setting up your environment, you're ready to start coding with Node.js! Refer to the course materials for your first exercises and projects.

If you encounter any issues during setup, please refer to the troubleshooting guides on the respective download pages or reach out in the course forum.

Happy coding!
